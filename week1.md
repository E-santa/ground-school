## Week 1 Notes
1. What software is there on our current drone?


The drone has two different computers: the flight controller and the onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano). As far as input mechanisms are concerned, it has a WiFi antenna, 2 GPS receivers, a 360 auto-stabilize gimbal camera, and other sensors.

For software, it has object detection, aerial imagery and stitching, the flight controller software (to keep the drone flying), and the onboard computer software (to provide higher-level guidance to the drone).

2. What kinds of challenges/projects can YOU work on as a Software team member?

I can help improve the flight controller by joining Reinforcement Learning research, help improve the stitching code, improve the object detection system, help 3D mapping for environmental research projects, or research anything else I want.

3. What’s the “industry standard” for drone software in 2025?

The "industry standard" for drone software is ROS for flight software, advanced SLAM, path planning, and AI inference for real-time autonomy, automated risk assessments and airspace alerts for compliance and safety, and cloud data integration. BVLOS and swarming are the most recent advancements.

4. How does one learn about drones effectively in 2025?

One learns about drones effectively in 2025 by asking AI for conceptual questions (or help with code) and gaining experience. One suggestion for learning about drones (or any other subject) effectively by talking with AI to make sure you understand it at a broad level, do projects, track your progress, combine AI with fact-checking for individual details, and reach out to others for help.
