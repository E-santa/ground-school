## Week 1 Notes
1. What software is there on our current drone?


The drone has two different computers: the flight controller and the onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano). As far as input mechanisms are concerned, it has a WiFi antenna, 2 GPS receivers, a 360 auto-stabilize gimbal camera, and other sensors.

For software, it has object detection, aerial imagery and stitching, the flight controller software (to keep the drone flying), and the onboard computer software (to provide higher-level guidance to the drone).

2. What kinds of challenges/projects can YOU work on as a Software team member?

I can help improve the flight controller by joining Reinforcement Learning research, help improve the stitching code, improve the object detection system, help 3D mapping for environmental research projects, or research anything else I want.

3. What’s the “industry standard” for drone software in 2025?
4. How does one learn about drones effectively in 2025?
